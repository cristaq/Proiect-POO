The purpose of the project is to distribute Santa Claus' gifts to
a database of children depending on their "nice score", preferences and
Santa's budget. The input and output are passed as JSON files.

children package
Here are all classes related to children. The Child class is abstract,
with implementations in Baby, Kid and Teen. They are basically just strategies
that calculate the nice score according to age category.
Factory creates children depending on age. It is also responsible for growing up,
transforming a Baby into a Kid after the age of 5, and a Kid into a Teen after
the age of 12. The strategies inherit an abstract class, leaving room for adding
new specific fields depending on the child.
The UpdateChild class contains all fields that can be found in an annual update.

database package
The AnnualChange class contains all updates from a year: updates to children, to gifts,
new budget etc.
ChildrenDatabase stores all children in a treemap, sorted by ID.
GiftDatabase stores all gifts.
Database contains the two aforementioned databases, as well as budgets.

Main
First we process the initial data adding all children and gifts to the Database.
Every year, we store the changes in AnnualChange and then we update the Database based on
those changes.
Every year we add the changes to a JsonArray that is going to represent the output.
